In Python, getter and setter methods are used to access and modify the values of private attributes of a class. These methods help in encapsulating the internal representation of an object's state and provide a controlled way to access or update the data.

Why Use Getters and Setters?
Encapsulation: Getters and setters help in hiding the internal representation of the data, ensuring that any changes to how the data is stored do not affect the rest of the code.
Validation: You can add validation logic in setters to ensure that only valid data is assigned to the attributes.
Read-Only Attributes: Using getters without setters allows you to create read-only attributes.
Example: Using Getter and Setter Methods
Let's create a class Person with a private attribute _age. We'll use getter and setter methods to access and update the value of _age.

python
Copy code
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self._age = age  # Private attribute
    
    # Getter method for 'age'
    def get_age(self):
        return self._age
    
    # Setter method for 'age'
    def set_age(self, age):
        if age >= 0:  # Validation logic
            self._age = age
        else:
            print("Age cannot be negative.")
    
# Example usage
person = Person("Aryan", 25)

# Accessing the age using the getter method
print(person.get_age())  # Output: 25

# Modifying the age using the setter method
person.set_age(30)
print(person.get_age())  # Output: 30

# Trying to set a negative age
person.set_age(-5)  # Output: Age cannot be negative.
Using Python's property() Function
Python provides a more elegant way to define getters and setters using the property() function, which can be used to make the code cleaner and more Pythonic.

Here's how you can do it:

python
Copy code
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self._age = age  # Private attribute
    
    @property
    def age(self):
        return self._age
    
    @age.setter
    def age(self, age):
        if age >= 0:  # Validation logic
            self._age = age
        else:
            print("Age cannot be negative.")

# Example usage
person = Person("Aryan", 25)

# Accessing the age using the property
print(person.age)  # Output: 25

# Modifying the age using the setter property
person.age = 30
print(person.age)  # Output: 30

# Trying to set a negative age
person.age = -5  # Output: Age cannot be negative.
Summary
Getter: A method that retrieves the value of a private attribute.
Setter: A method that sets or updates the value of a private attribute, often with validation.
Property: A built-in way in Python to create getters and setters in a clean and Pythonic way using the @property decorator.

Certainly! Let's break down how getters and setters work in Python, particularly focusing on the example using the property() function.

1. Private Attributes
In Python, attributes prefixed with an underscore (_) are considered private by convention. This means they are not intended to be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, you access and modify these attributes using getter and setter methods.

python
Copy code
self._age = age  # '_age' is a private attribute
2. Getter Method
A getter method allows you to access the value of a private attribute from outside the class. In the example, the age method decorated with @property is a getter.

python
Copy code
@property
def age(self):
    return self._age
@property: This decorator makes the age method act like an attribute when accessed, meaning you can simply use person.age instead of person.get_age().

Functionality: When you access person.age, the age method is called, and it returns the value of the private attribute _age.

3. Setter Method
A setter method allows you to modify the value of a private attribute from outside the class. The age method decorated with @age.setter is a setter.

python
Copy code
@age.setter
def age(self, age):
    if age >= 0:  # Validation logic
        self._age = age
    else:
        print("Age cannot be negative.")
@age.setter: This decorator creates a setter for the age property, allowing you to set the value using person.age = new_value.

Functionality: When you assign a new value to person.age, the setter method is called with the new value (age). The method checks if the value is valid (e.g., age should be non-negative). If the value is valid, it updates the _age attribute; otherwise, it prints an error message.

4. How It Works Together
With the @property and @age.setter decorators, you can interact with the _age attribute in a natural and intuitive way:

Accessing (Getter): When you access person.age, Python internally calls the getter method (age) and returns _age.

python
Copy code
print(person.age)  # Calls the getter and prints the value of '_age'
Modifying (Setter): When you assign a value to person.age, Python internally calls the setter method (age) with the new value.

python
Copy code
person.age = 30  # Calls the setter and updates '_age' to 30
5. Why Use Them?
Encapsulation: You can control how the internal attributes are accessed and modified, ensuring that they are used correctly (e.g., age cannot be negative).
Maintainability: If you later change how the data is stored (e.g., you store age in months instead of years), you only need to update the getter and setter methods, not the entire codebase.
Readability: The use of @property makes your class attributes look like regular attributes, leading to cleaner and more readable code.
Summary
Getter: Allows read-only access to a private attribute.
Setter: Allows controlled modification of a private attribute, with optional validation.
Property: Combines getter and setter methods into a single attribute-like interface, enhancing encapsulation and readability.
