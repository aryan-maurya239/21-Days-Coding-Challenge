### **Python Notes**

---

#### **1. Class and Object**
   - **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (instances). It encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit.
   - **Object**: An instance of a class. It is created from the class blueprint and can access the data and behaviors defined in the class.

---

#### **2. Class Definition**
   - Define a class using the `class` keyword.
   - Syntax:
     ```python
     class ClassName:
         # class attributes and methods
     ```
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Dog:
         def bark(self):
             print("Woof!")
     ```

---

#### **3. Creating Objects (Instances)**
   - To create an object (instance) of a class, call the class using parentheses.
   - Example:
     ```python
     my_dog = Dog()
     my_dog.bark()  # Outputs: Woof!
     ```

---

#### **4. Constructors**
   - A constructor is a special method called automatically when an object is created.
   - In Python, the constructor is defined using the `__init__` method.

---

#### **5. `__init__` Method**
   - The `__init__` method initializes the objectâ€™s attributes and is called automatically when a new object is created.
   - Syntax:
     ```python
     def __init__(self, parameters):
         # initialize attributes
     ```
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Dog:
         def __init__(self, name, age):
             self.name = name
             self.age = age
     ```

---

#### **6. Parameterized and Non-Parameterized Constructors**
   - **Parameterized Constructor**: Accepts arguments and initializes the object with specific values.
     ```python
     class Dog:
         def __init__(self, name, age):
             self.name = name
             self.age = age
     my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 5)
     ```
   - **Non-Parameterized Constructor**: Does not take any arguments and usually initializes attributes with default values.
     ```python
     class Dog:
         def __init__(self):
             self.name = "Unknown"
             self.age = 0
     my_dog = Dog()
     ```

---

#### **7. `self` Keyword**
   - The `self` keyword represents the instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods associated with the current object.
   - It must be the first parameter in instance methods.

---

#### **8. Usage and Significance of `self`**
   - `self` is used to differentiate between instance variables/methods and local variables/methods.
   - It ensures that the correct attributes are accessed or modified.

---

#### **9. Instance Variables and Methods**
   - **Instance Variables**: Variables that are unique to each object. They are usually defined within the `__init__` method.
   - **Instance Methods**: Methods that act on the instance variables of an object.

---

#### **10. Defining Instance Variables**
   - Instance variables are defined using `self` within the `__init__` method or other instance methods.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Dog:
         def __init__(self, name):
             self.name = name  # Instance variable
     ```

---

#### **11. Instance Methods**
   - Methods that operate on instance variables and typically use `self` as their first parameter.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Dog:
         def bark(self):
             print(f"{self.name} says woof!")
     ```

---

#### **12. Class Variables and Methods**
   - **Class Variables**: Variables that are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any instance methods.
   - **Class Methods**: Methods that act on class variables and usually have `cls` as their first parameter.

---

#### **13. Defining Class Variables**
   - Class variables are defined inside the class but outside of any method.
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Dog:
         species = "Canis lupus"  # Class variable
     ```

---

#### **14. Class Methods (`@classmethod`)**
   - A class method is defined using the `@classmethod` decorator. It takes `cls` as its first parameter, representing the class itself.
   - Syntax:
     ```python
     @classmethod
     def method_name(cls, parameters):
         # method body
     ```
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Dog:
         species = "Canis lupus"
         
         @classmethod
         def get_species(cls):
             return cls.species
     ```

---

#### **15. Static Methods (`@staticmethod`)**
   - Static methods do not depend on class or instance variables. They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.
   - Syntax:
     ```python
     @staticmethod
     def method_name(parameters):
         # method body
     ```
   - Example:
     ```python
     class Dog:
         @staticmethod
         def bark():
             print("Woof!")
     ```
